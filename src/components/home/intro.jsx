                                I have 8 years experience in web development,
                                ranging from in-house work for an eCommerce business
                                to working with digital and creative agencies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My preferred stack is typically Vue or React on the frontend
                                with Flux-based state management. Backend is Node.js on serverless AWS infrastructure or PHP, where my
                                framework of choice would be Laravel.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of my recent work has been frontend-focused
                                projects but I mostly enjoy building software that solves real
                                business problems, where there is typically more focus on the backend.
                            </p>
