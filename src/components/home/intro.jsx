                            I&apos;ve been building for the web since around 2013, when I wrote some macros for World of Warcraft and realised I might actually enjoy this coding thing. Not long after, I broke production at a small family-run eCommerce company where I was meant to be working as an accountant. Good times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Somehow they let me carry on, and I ended up building tools and systems that saved money and drove revenue. Some of them even worked. I fully moved out of finance in 2017 and into proper development roles, where I picked up a sense for clean UX, solid architecture, and code that could be trusted and scaled.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I&apos;ve had roles with different levels of freedom, and I&apos;ve learned a lot from all of them. But what I really love is solving real problems. Getting obsessed with a challenge and building something that works.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I went all in recently and built my own <Link className="link" to="/my-work/comprensi/language-learning-platform">solo startup</Link>. It felt ideal at first. But honestly, it&apos;s lonely. I realised a big part of what I enjoy is the collaboration. Building with others, sharing the highs and lows.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So that&apos;s what I&apos;m looking for now â€” early stage teams with smart people and a sense of purpose. If that&apos;s you, let&apos;s chat.
