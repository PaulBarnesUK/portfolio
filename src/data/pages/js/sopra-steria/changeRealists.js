            `As part of MOI Global's marketing campaign "The Change Realists", Sopra Steria required a 
            dynamic landing page which changed based on how the user had reached the page. I used 
            the new static generator for Vue.js, "Gridsome", for this.`,
            `Similar to Nuxt and Gatsby (React static site generator), 
            this enabled all the benefits of a JavaScript frontend framework, while still maintaining
            all the SEO benefits of a static website, along with common performance techniques such as 
            lazily loaded images and code splitting`,
            `As one of the main goals of the campaign was to generate leads for the client, a gating mechanism was 
            implemented to capture user information prior to unlocking the landing page's content. This meant integrating 
            with APIs such as TypeForm and Eloqua.`
